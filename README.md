# Futurepages Web Framework V.4

Futurepages is designed for Web Applications with Java 8 and JEE6.

Futurepages Web Framework is written in Java and its source code is open under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0), an OSI Approved License. LGPL-3.0 is a set of additional permissions added to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
